What we have done:
# the initialization of the game - create the player, food, and enemy

22nd Feb 2025 Fourth Meeting - supplement and debug

What we have done:
# adjust zooming of the map

# set the direction of the enemy: when the enemy is smaller than the player, it would escape away from the player.
